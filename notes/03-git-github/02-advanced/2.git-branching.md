# GIT BRANCHING

## Git branch

Git allows us to create branches to experiment with versions of a project. Imagine you want to create a version of a story with a happy ending. You can create a new branch and make the happy ending changes to that branch only. It will have no effect on the `main` branch until you’re ready to merge the happy ending to the `main` branch.

we’ll be using Git branching to develop multiple versions of a resumé.

You can use the command below to answer the question: “which branch am I on?”

```bash
git branch
```

In the output, the `*` (asterisk) is showing you what branch you’re on.

## Branching overview

![Branching](../assets/git-diagram-1.svg)

The diagram illustrates branching.

The circles are commits, and together form the Git project’s commit history.
New Branch is a different version of the Git project. It contains commits from the main branch but also has commits that it does not have.

## git branch 2

To create a new branch, use:

```bash
git branch new_branch
```

Here new_branch would be the name of the new branch you create, like `photos` or `blurb`. Be sure to name your branch something that describes the purpose of the branch. Also, branch names can’t contain whitespaces: `new-branch` and `new_branch` are valid branch names, but `new branch` is not.

## DIFF BRANCHES

Which branches are merged with master, and can be cleaned
up?

- `git branch --merged master`

Which branches aren’t merged with master yet?

- `git branch --no-merged master`

## git checkout

You can switch to the new branch with

```bash
git checkout branch_name

```

Here, branch_name is the name of the branch. If the branch’s name is `skill`

```bash
git checkout skill
```

In the output, notice the `*` is now over the new branch.

Once you switch branches, you will now be able to make commits on the branch that have no impact on `main`.

There's a short command to switch to the previous branch :

```bash
git checkout -
```

## commit on a new branch

All the commands you do on `main`, you can also do on this branch.

For example, to add files to the staging area, use:

```bash
git add filename
```

And to commit, use:

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

## git merge

What if you wanted to include all the changes made to the new branch on the `main` branch? We can easily accomplish this by merging the branch into `main` with:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge branch_name
```

For example, if I wanted to merge the skills branch to `main`, I would enter :

```bash
git checkout main
git merge skills
```

To retain the history of a merge commit, even if there are no
changes to the base branch:

```bash
git checkout master
git merge skills --no-ff
```

This will force a merge commit, even when one isn’t necessary

## Merge conflict I

What would happen if you made a commit on `main` before you merged the two branches?
Furthermore, what if the commit you made on `main` altered the same line you worked on in the new branch?

When you switch back to `main` and ask Git to merge the two branches, Git doesn’t know which changes you want to keep. This is called a merge conflict.

## merge conflict II

Let’s say you decide you’d like to merge the changes from the `new_branch` into `main`.
Here’s where the trouble begins!

You’ve made commits on separate branches that alter the same line in conflicting ways.
Git will not know which version of the file to keep

```bash
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in filename.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Git also uses markings to indicate the HEAD (main) version of the file and the `new_branch` version of the file, like this:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
main version of line
=======
new_branch version of line
>>>>>>> new_branch
```

**Note**:
If the markings are not showing in your file, please close your file and re-open it.

Git asks us which version of the file to keep: the version on master or the version on fencing. If you decide you want the `new_branch` version, From the code editor:

- Delete the content of the line as it appears in the `main` branch
- Delete all of Git’s **special markings** including the words HEAD and new_branch. If any of Git’s markings remain, for example, `>>>>>>>` and `=======,` the conflict remains.

## GIT RERERE - REUSE RECORDED RESOLUTION

git saves how you resolved a conﬂict. On the next conﬂict, git will reuse the same resolution.
It's useful for:

- long lived feature branch (like a refactor)
- rebasing

To Turn it on:

- git `config rerere.enabled true`
- or you can also use `--global` ﬂag to enable for _all_ projects

```bash
git config rerere.enabled true

# Merge attempt
❯ git checkout master
❯ git merge feature
Auto-merging feature

# Conflict occurs
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in file
Recorded preimage for 'file'
Automatic merge failed;

### Fix the merge conflict in file and commit result.
❯ git add file
❯ git commit -m "Resolve conflict"

### Git tells you that resolution was recorded fo that conflict i.e next time same conflict occurs same resolution will be applied.
Recorded resolution for 'feature'.
[master 0fe266d] Resolve conflict
```

Now: Feature wasn’t ready, I undid the merge.

When I try to merge again :

```bash
git merge feature
Auto-merging feature
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in feature
Resolved 'feature' using previous resolution.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
❯ git add file
❯ git diff --staged
diff --git a/file b/file
index 587be6b..a354eda 100644
--- a/file
+++ b/file
@@ -1 +1 @@
-The old change
+This is how I resolved my conflict.
\ No newline at end of file
```

## delete branch

In Git, branches are usually a means to an end. You create them to work on a new project feature, but the end goal is to merge that feature into the `main` branch. After the branch has been integrated into `main`, it has served its purpose and can be deleted.

The command

```bash
git branch -d branch_name
```

will delete the specified branch from your Git project

## Summary

- Git branching allows users to experiment with different versions of a project by checking out separate branches to work on.

The following commands are useful in the Git branch workflow :

- git branch: Lists all a Git project’s branches.
- git branch branch_name: Creates a new branch.
- git checkout branch_name: Used to switch from one branch to another.
- git merge branch_name: Used to join file changes from one branch to another.
- git branch -d branch_name: Deletes the branch specified.
