# HOW TO BACKTRACK

## Backtracking

When working on a Git project, sometimes we make changes that we want to get rid of. Git offers a few eraser-like features that allow us to undo mistakes during project creation.

### head commit

In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the `HEAD` commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the `HEAD` commit.

To see the `HEAD` commit, enter:

```bash
git show HEAD
```

The output of this command will display everything the `git log` command displays for the `HEAD` commit, plus all the file changes that were committed.

### git checkout

The command :

```bash
git checkout HEAD filename
```

will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit. Filename refers to the actual name of the file.
