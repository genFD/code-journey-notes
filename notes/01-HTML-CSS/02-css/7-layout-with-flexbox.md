## Notes

_tldr_:

1. display: flex changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.

2. display: inline-flex allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.

3. justify-content is used to space items along the main axis.

4. align-items is used to space items along the cross axis.

5. flex-grow is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis.

6. flex-shrink is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.

7. flex-basis is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with flex-grow and/or flex-shrink.

8. flex is used to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in one declaration

9. flex-wrap specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.

10. align-content is used to space rows along the cross axis.

11. flex-flow is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one declaration.

12. Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by declaring display: flex or display: inline-flex for children of flex containers.

13. flex-direction is used to specify the main and cross axes.

### What is Flexbox?

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

Flexible Box Layout or flexbox is a tool that greatly simplifies how to position elements on a web page.

There are two important components to a flexbox layout: flex containers and flex items.

- A flex container is an `element on a page that contains flex items`.

- All `direct child elements of a flex container` are flex items

Why is this distinction important?

`some of the properties you will learn in this lesson apply to flex containers while others apply to flex items`.

How to designate an element as a flex container ?

- set the element‚Äôs display property to flex or inline-flex

Once an item is a flex container, there are several properties we can use to specify how its children behave. In this lesson we will cover these properties

1. justify-content
2. align-items
3. flex-grow
4. flex-shrink
5. flex-basis
6. flex
7. flex-wrap
8. align-content
9. flex-direction
10. flex-flow

### Display: flex

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

- Flex containers are
  `helpful tools for creating websites that respond to changes in screen sizes`

- For an element to become a flex container, its display property must be set to flex

```css
div.container {
  display: flex;
}
```

In the example above :

- all divs with the class container are flex containers
- If they have children, the children are flex items.
- A div with the declaration display: flex; will remain block level, meaning, no other elements will appear on the same line as it.
- However, it will change the behavior of its child elements.
- Child elements will not begin on new lines

### Inline-flex

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

When we don't want div elements to be block-level elements, we would use `display: inline`.

Flexbox, however, provides the inline-flex value for the display property,

- which allows us to create flex containers that are also inline elements

```html
<div class="container">
  <p>I‚Äôm inside of a flex container!</p>
  <p>A flex container‚Äôs children are flex items!</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <p>I‚Äôm also a flex item!</p>
  <p>Me too!</p>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  display: inline-flex;
}
```

In the example above:

- there are two container divs.
- Without a width, each div would stretch the entire width of the page.
- The paragraphs within each div would also display on top of each other because paragraphs are block-level elements.
- When we change the value of the display property to `inline-flex`, the divs will display inline with each other if the page is wide enough.
- Also the size of the flex container is set.
- If the parent element is too small, the flex items will shrink to accommodate the parent container‚Äôs size.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="child">
    <h1>1</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="child">
    <h1>2</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
}

.child {
  display: inline-flex;
  width: 150px;
  height: auto;
}
```

In the example above,

- the .child divs will take up more width (300 pixels) than the container div allows (200 pixels)
- The .child divs will shrink to accommodate the container‚Äôs size.

We will explore several ways to handle this.

### Justify-content

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

The default behavior of flex items is to

- move toward the upper left corner of the parent container.

We can

- specify `how flex items spread out from left to right`, along the main axis

To `position the items from left to right`, we use a property called `justify-content`.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}
```

There are five commonly used values for the justify-content property:

`flex-start` ‚Äî all items will be positioned in order, starting from the left of the parent container, with no extra space between or before them.

`flex-end` ‚Äî all items will be positioned in order, with the last item starting on the right side of the parent container, with no extra space between or after them.

`center` ‚Äî all items will be positioned in order, in the center of the parent container with no extra space before, between, or after them.

`space-around` ‚Äî items will be positioned with equal space before and after each item, resulting in double the space between elements.

`space-between` ‚Äî items will be positioned with equal space between them, but no extra space before the first or after the last elements.

In the definitions above, ‚Äúno extra space‚Äù means that margins and borders will be respected, but no more space (than is specified in the style rule for the particular element) will be added between elements. The size of each individual flex item is not changed by this property.

### Align-items

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

To `position flex items vertically (top-bottom)` within the container, we use the `align-items` property.

```css
.container {
  align-items: baseline;
}
```

There are five commonly used values for the align-items property:

`flex-start` ‚Äî all elements will be positioned at the top of the parent container.

`flex-end` ‚Äî all elements will be positioned at the bottom of the parent container.

`center` ‚Äî the center of all elements will be positioned halfway between the top and bottom of the parent container.

`baseline` ‚Äî the bottom of the content of all items will be aligned with each other.

`stretch` ‚Äî if possible, the items will stretch from top to bottom of the container (this is the default value; `elements with a specified height will not stretch`; `elements with a minimum height or no height specified will stretch`).

These five values tell the elements `how to behave along the cross axis of the parent container`.

You might be unfamiliar with the min-height and max-height properties, but you have used height and width before. min-height, max-height, min-width, and max-width are properties that ensure an element is at least a certain size or at most a certain size. You‚Äôll see how these become useful as you move throughout this lesson.

### Flex-grow

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

- all flex items shrink proportionally when the flex container is too small,

But when the parent container is larger than necessary :

- the flex items will not stretch by default.

It's possible to

- `Specify if items should grow to fill a container`
- `and also which items should grow proportionally more or less than others`.

We use the `flex-grow` property.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="side">
    <h1>I‚Äôm on the side of the flex container!</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h1>I'm in the center of the flex container!</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="side">
    <h1>I'm on the other side of the flex container!</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.side {
  width: 100px;
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.center {
  width: 100px;
  flex-grow: 2;
}
```

In the example above :

- the .container div has a display value of flex, so its three child divs will be positioned next to each other.

- If there is additional space in the .container div (in this case, if it is wider than 300 pixels), the flex items will grow to fill it

- The .center div will stretch twice as much as the .side divs. ex: `if there were 60 additional pixels of space, the center div would absorb 30 pixels and the side divs would absorb 15 pixels each`.

- If a `max-width` is set for an element, it will not grow larger than that even if there is more space for it to absorb.

### Flex-shrink

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

the `flex-shrink` property can be used to

- specify which elements will shrink
- and in what proportions.

flex items shrink when the flex container is too small, even though we had not declared the property. This is because the default value of `flex-shrink is 1`.

However, flex items do not grow unless the flex-grow property is declared because the default value of flex-grow is 0.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="side">
    <h1>I'm on the side of the flex container!</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h1>I'm in the center of the flex container!</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="side">
    <h1>I'm on the other side of the flex container!</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.side {
  width: 100px;
  flex-shrink: 1;
}

.center {
  width: 100px;
  flex-shrink: 2;
}
```

In the example above :

- the .center div will shrink twice as much as the .side divs if the .container div is too small to fit the elements within it .

- `If the content is 60 pixels too large for the flex container` that surrounds it, the .center div will shrink by 30 pixels and the outer divs will shrink by 15 pixels each.

- Keep in mind minimum and maximum widths will take precedence over flex-grow and flex-shrink

- As with flex-grow, flex-shrink will only be employed if the parent container is too small or the browser is adjusted.

### Flex-basis

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

In the previous two exercises,

- the dimensions of the divs were determined by heights and widths set with CSS.
- Another way of specifying the width of a flex item is with the flex-basis property.
- flex-basis allows us to `specify the width of an item before it stretches or shrinks`.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="side">
    <h1>Left side!</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h1>Center!</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="side">
    <h1>Right side!</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
}

.side {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: 100px;
}

.center {
  flex-grow: 2;
  flex-basis: 150px;
}
```

In the example above,

If the `.container div` has just the right amount of space (350 pixels, plus a little extra for margins and borders)

- the .side divs will be 100 pixels wide and the .center div will be 150 pixels wide.

If the .container div is larger,

- the .center div will absorb twice as much space as the .side divs.

### Flex

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

The shorthand flex property provides a convenient way for :

- `specifying how elements stretch and shrink`
- it allows you to declare `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` all in one line

```css
.big {
  flex-grow: 2;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  flex-basis: 150px;
}

.small {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 2;
  flex-basis: 100px;
}
```

In the example above all elements with class big :

- will grow twice as much as elements with class small, `they‚Äôll just take up more of the extra space`.

The CSS below declares these three properties `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` (in that order) all in one lin in one line.

```css
.big {
  flex: 2 1 150px;
}

.small {
  flex: 1 2 100px;
}
```

_technical communication_:

If the css above Stretch the browser window to increase its width. Observe that once the divs with class big reach 150 pixels wide, they begin to grow faster than the divs with the `small` class. Also notice that once the divs with the `small` class reaches 100 pixels wide, it begins to shrink faster than the divs with the `big` class.

- we can use the flex property to declare `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink`, but not flex-basis

```css
.big {
  flex: 2 1;
}
```

- we can use the flex property to declare `flex-grow` and `flex-basis`

```css
.small {
  flex: 1 20px;
}
```

**Note: that there is no way to set only flex-shrink and flex-basis using 2 values.**

### flex-wrap

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

When :

- We don‚Äôt want our content to shrink to fit its container.
- We want flex items to move to the next line when necessary.

We can use the `flex-wrap` property.

The flex-wrap property can accept three values:

1. `wrap` ‚Äî flex-items that don‚Äôt fit into a row will move down to the next line

2. `wrap-reverse` ‚Äî the same functionality as wrap, but the order of rows within a flex container is reversed (for example, in a 2-row flexbox, the first row from a wrap container will become the second in wrap-reverse and the second row from the wrap container will become the first in wrap-reverse)

3. `nowrap` ‚Äî prevents items from wrapping; this is the default value and is only necessary to override a wrap value set by a different CSS rule.

```html
<div class="container">
  <!-- 1 -->
  <div class="item">
    <h1>We're going to wrap!</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- 2 -->
  <div class="item">
    <h1>We're going to wrap!</h1>
  </div>

  <!-- 3 -->
  <div class="item">
    <h1>We're going to wrap!</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: inline-flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  width: 250px;
}

.item {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

In the example above :

- three flex items are contained by a parent flex container
- The flex container is only 250 pixels wide so the three 100 pixel wide flex items cannot fit inline.
- Because we set the flex-wrap property to wrap, the third overflowing item will appear on a new line, below the other two items.

**Note: The flex-wrap property is declared on flex containers.**

### align-content

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

Now that elements can wrap to the next line, we might have multiple rows of flex items within the same container. In a previous exercise, we used the align-items property to space flex items from the top to the bottom of a flex container. `however` align-items is for aligning elements within a single row.

- `If a flex container has multiple rows of content,` we can use align-content `to space the rows from top to bottom.`

Some of the more commonly used align-content values:

1. `flex-start` ‚Äî all rows of elements will be positioned at the top of the parent container with no extra space between.

2. `flex-end` ‚Äî all rows of elements will be positioned at the bottom of the parent container with no extra space between.

3. `center` ‚Äî all rows of elements will be positioned at the center of the parent element with no extra space between.

4. `space-between` ‚Äî all rows of elements will be spaced evenly from the top to the bottom of the container with no space above the first or below the last.

5. `space-around` ‚Äî all rows of elements will be spaced evenly from the top to the bottom of the container with the same amount of space at the top and bottom and between each element.

6. `stretch` ‚Äî if a minimum height or no height is specified, the rows of elements will stretch to fill the parent container from top to bottom (default value).

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="child">
    <h1>1</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="child">
    <h1>2</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="child">
    <h1>3</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="child">
    <h1>4</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  width: 400px;
  height: 400px;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: space-around;
}

.child {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
}
```

_technical communication_:

In the example above,

- there are four flex items inside of a flex container.

- The flex items are set to be 150 pixels wide each, but the parent container is only 400 pixels wide.

- This means that no more than two elements can be displayed inline.

- The other two elements will wrap to the next line and there will be two rows of divs inside of the flex container.

- The align-content property is set to the value of space-around, which means the two rows of divs will be evenly spaced from top to bottom of the parent container with equal space before the first row and after the second, with double space between the rows.

### flex-direction

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

flex containers have two axes:

- a main axis and a cross axis.
- By default, the main axis is horizontal(left to right) and the cross axis is vertical(top bottom).

The main axis is used to position flex items with the following properties:

1. justify-content
2. flex-wrap
3. flex-grow
4. flex-shrink

The cross axis is used to position flex items with the following properties:

1. align-items
2. align-content

- The main axis and cross axis are interchangeable. We can switch them using the flex-direction property.
- If we add the flex-direction property and give it a value of column, the flex items will be ordered vertically, not horizontally.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item">
    <h1>1</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="item">
    <h1>2</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="item">
    <h1>3</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="item">
    <h1>4</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="item">
    <h1>5</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: 1000px;
}
.item {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100px;
}
```

In the example above :

- the five divs will be positioned in a vertical column
- All of these divs could fit in one horizontal row.
- However, the column value tells the browser to stack the divs one on top of the other.
- properties like justify-content will not behave the way they did in previous examples.

The flex-direction property can accept four values:

1. `row` ‚Äî elements will be positioned from left to right across the parent element starting from the top left corner (default).
2. `row-reverse` ‚Äî elements will be positioned from right to left across the parent element starting from the top right corner.
3. `column` ‚Äî elements will be positioned from top to bottom of the parent element starting from the top left corner.
4. `column-reverse` ‚Äî elements will be positioned from the bottom to the top of the parent element starting from the bottom left corner.

### flex-flow

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

- The shorthand `flex-flow` property is used to declare both `the flex-wrap` and `flex-direction` properties in one line.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

In the example above, we take two lines to accomplish what can be done with one.
the first value in the flex-flow declaration is a flex-direction value and the second is a flex-wrap value

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap;
}
```

### Nested Flexboxes

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

It is also possible to position flex containers inside of one another

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="left">
    <img class="small" src="#" />
    <img class="small" src="#" />
    <img class="small" src="#" />
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <img class="large" src="#" />
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.left {
  display: inline-flex;
  flex: 2 1 200px;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.right {
  display: inline-flex;
  flex: 1 2 400px;
  align-items: center;
}

.small {
  height: 200px;
  width: auto;
}

.large {
  height: 600px;
  width: auto;
}
```

In the example above, :

- a div with three smaller images will display from top to bottom on the left of the page (.left).

- There is also a div with one large image that will display on the right side of the page (.right).

- The left div has a smaller flex-basis but stretches to fill more extra space

- the right div has a larger flex-basis but stretches to fill less extra space.

- Both divs are flex items and flex containers.
