What Happens when we browse to a website ?

- When we browse to a website our web browser sends a request to the server where the files that make up the website are hosted.

- the server will send back a response with those files (html, css, JS)

- Once browser receive those files it'll take the code and `render the website`

Front-end Development

- The process of writting HTML, CSS and JS is called `front-end Development`

Static website

- Website where the files are sent from the server to the browser as they are

Back-end Development

- The process of writting the application that sends those files to the browser is called backend Development

HTML

- Language deals with the `Content` of the page

CSS

JS
