## Learning Objectives

- Learning how to set up an HTML file.

## Notes

_TLDR_:

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.

- The `<html>` element will contain all of your HTML code

- Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the `<head>` of the page.

- You can add a title to your web page by using the `<title>` element, inside of the head.

- A webpage‚Äôs title appears in a browser‚Äôs tab

- Anchor tags `(<a>)` are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.

- You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using `<a>` tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.

- Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.

- Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.

- Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: `<!-- comment -->`.

### `Preparing for HTML`

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

- We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.

The declaration looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. The browser will correctly assume that the html in <!DOCTYPE html> is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard.

### The `<html>` Tag

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

The <!DOCTYPE html> doesn‚Äôt actually add any HTML structure or content.

- To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing `<html>` tags after declaring `<!DOCTYPE html>`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html></html>
```

Anything between the opening `<html>` and closing `</html>` tags will be interpreted as HTML code.

### The `<head>` element

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

So far you‚Äôve done two things to set up the file properly:

- Declared to the browser that your code is HTML with <!DOCTYPE html>
- Added the HTML element `(<html>)` that will contain the rest of your code.

Let‚Äôs also give the browser some information about the page itself. We can do this by adding a `<head>` element.

- The `<head>` element contains the metadata for a web page.
- Metadata is information about the page that isn‚Äôt displayed directly on the web page, unlike the information inside of the `<body>` tag.
- Examples of metadata include: the `title` of the web page.
  A browser‚Äôs tab displays the title specified in the `<title>` tag. The `<title>` tag is always inside of the `<head>`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The new title</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

### `Linking to Other Web Pages`

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element `<a>` and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags

```html
<a>This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
```

The anchor element in the example above is incomplete without the href attribute. This attribute stands for `hyperlink` reference and is used to link to a path, or the address to where a file is located

```html
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">This Is A Link To Wikipedia</a>
```

#### `Opening Links in a New Window`

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

- The `target` attribute specifies how a link should open.

- For a link to open in a new window(tab), the target attribute requires a value of `_blank`

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"
  >The Brown Bear</a
>
```

#### `Linking to Relative Page`

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

How to link to internal web pages like Home, About, and Contact?

```md
project-folder/
|‚Äî‚Äî about.html
|‚Äî‚Äî contact.html
|‚Äî‚Äî index.html
```

The example above shows three different files ‚Äî about.html, contact.html, and index.html in one folder.

Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.

```html
<a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>
```

#### `Linking At Will`

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

So far, we‚Äôve added links that were made up of only text, like the following:

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank">Prickly Pear</a>
```

HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, it‚Äôs possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the `<img>` element with an `<a>` element.

```html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank"
  ><img
    src="https://www.Prickly_Pear_Closeup.jpg"
    alt="A red prickly pear fruit"
/></a>
```

#### `Linking to Same Page`

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

How do we make it easier for a user to jump to different portions of our page?
When users visit our site, we want them to be able to click a link and have the page automatically scroll to a specific section.

In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an `id`, like this:

```html
<p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
<h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom!</h1>
```

The target link is a string containing the `#` character and the target element‚Äôs id.

```html
<ol>
  <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>
  <li><a href="#bottom">Bottom</a></li>
</ol>
```
