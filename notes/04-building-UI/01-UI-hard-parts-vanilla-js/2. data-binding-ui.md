# Data Binding in the UI

`TLDR`:

- The DOM is a representation of the elements that rendered on the page
- Javascript allows us to create and save data/state
- The Document object allow us (developers) to interact in JS with the DOM and therefore add data/state on the page
- Event handlers allow us to let the user change data in JS (and therefore re-update the DOM - re-render)

## How do we change our view based on multiple user interactions?

In the snippet below we have 2 types of interactions :

- User can change the input's value.
- User can click on input clear the input field

```html
<input />
<div></div>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

```js
let post = ''
const jsdiv = document.querySelector('div')

const jsInput = document.querySelector('input')

jsInput.value = 'hi' //affect the value

function handleInput() {
  post = jsInput.value
  jsDiv.textContent = post //affect the view
}

function handleClick() {
  jsInput.value = '' // affect the view
}

jsInput.onInput = handleInput
jsInput.onClick = handleClick
```

### Code description

1. script triggers js engine : `<script src="app.js"></script>`

2. memory in js is populated with the `document object` full of methods and properties that allow us to interact with DOM

3. define a variable post and assign to it an empty string

4. define the constant jsdiv and assign it the result of calling the querySelector method. as a result, an accessor object is created, full of properties and methods to interact with the div node in the DOM.

5. define the constant jsInput and assign it the result of calling the querySelector method. as a result, an accessor object is created, full of properties and methods to interact with the input node in the DOM.

6. Access the jsInput object acessor and set the `value` property to an the string 'hi'. as a result the DOM is updated and the input element shows 'hi'.

7. define a function handleInput.

8. define a function handleClick.

9. Access the jsInput object acessor and set the `onInput` property to the function `handleInput`.

10. Access the jsInput object acessor and set the `onClick` property to the function `handleClick`.

### User action

1. When the user clicks on the input it triggers the handleClick function. The function is executed and as a result the input gets cleared : `post = jsInput.value`

2. When the user types 'hi' in the input it triggers the handleInput function. The function is executed and as a result :

- data change in JS, the variable post is set to 'hi' : `post = jsInput.value`

- the view also changes. The page re-render because the DOM is updated : `jsDiv.textContent = post`

**Note**: The problem with this approach is that we re-rendering the page based on multiple interactions. What if we could have a single function to change the data and therefore change the view?
