# Introduction to build tools

## What are Build Tools?

![process](../assets/process-review.svg)

Build tools can assist you with:

- Combining JavaScript modules and CSS into bundled files for production.
- Minifying files for improved performance.
- Running unit tests with one command.
- Automatically previewing changes to your application.

You could be already using build tools and might not even realize it! Many popular frameworks and libraries utilize build tools to automate processes. For example, [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/signup/) utilize build tools to automate aspects of their development and deployment processes.

There are several types of build tools:

- `Package Managers`, such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), are used to _install and manage_ Node.js packages.

- `Bundlers` are used to efficiently _bundle_ assets such as JavaScript files, images, and fonts. A few examples of the more commonly used bundlers are [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

- `Task runners`, such as [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), are used to _automate_ the process of running repetitive workflows.

So what are Build Tools? Build tools are tools that can be used to _enhance_ the `performance` of complex web apps.

## The Web development ecosystem : how build tools fit into the overall web development ecosystem ?

![Ecosystem](../assets/web-dev-ecosystem.svg)

Build tools are a part of a larger web development ecosystem of tools, used to create web applications.

We can divide the process of producing a web app into three stages:

1. development
2. testing
3. deployment.

Build tools can assist with all of them!

- In development, build tools can simplify the way different types of resources can be combined.
- The process of testing and deployment can be automated by task runners, and the content served in the deployment stage is often produced by bundlers.

_Key idea:_

Build tools’ role in the web development ecosystem is to _bundle_ code and _automate_ a certain development process such as testing.

## Types of build tools : what are the differences between task runners and bundlers?

Let’s focus on two types of build tools, task runners and bundlers.

- `Task runners` _automate_ certain development processes, such as _compiling_ code from SCSS to CSS or Typescript to JavaScript. Commonly used task runners for JavaScript [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/).

- `Bundlers` _package_ JavaScript files and other assets such as stylesheets, images, and fonts into bundled files. Bundlers remove unused and duplicated code, improving download speed. Commonly used bundlers include [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Many applications can get away with using simple task runners. However, complex applications that use a lot of assets may need both automation and bundling.

## Dependency graphs : how bundlers use dependency graphs to map out the connection between resources?

The `connections` between assets _need to be mapped_ by the bundler to produce an output containing everything the app needs. This process uses a data structure called a _dependency graph_.

A dependency graph is a type of data structure. A data structure is a `way` of _arranging_ data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

In a dependency graph, When one file depends on another, a connection is added to the graph. Once all the connections are added, the bundler knows exactly what it must incorporate into the build.

Here's an example :

![Dependency graph](../assets/dependency-graph.svg)

- **index.js** depends on two files: **style.css** and **user.js.**
- **style.css** also has a dependency for a font file, **font.woff**.
- **user.js** depends on another JavaScript file, **util.js**, and two image assets, **banner.png** and **profile.png**.

_Key idea:_

A dependency graph `maps the connections between different files` to tell the bundler what needs to be included in order to build the application.

## Improving performance : what are the processes bundlers use to improve performance?

_The problem :_

Large and complex application can take a long time to download in the browser if not optimized.

_Solution :_

Build tools utilize processes such as code-splitting, minification, dead-code elimination, and tree-shaking to reduce the size of downloads.

- `Code-splitting` is a technique that allows you to split your code into multiple files or chunks that can be loaded as needed.

- `Minification` is a process that removes comments, whitespace, and other unneeded data from your code. References in the code can also be renamed so that the resulting bundle is smaller.

- `Dead-code elimination` aims to remove any code not actually used by the finished application.

- `Tree-shaking` is a type of dead-code elimination that searches included modules for files and functions that are not used.

## About Linting

Linters can **help your code be free of errors and vulnerabilities**!

Do you ever get tired of making all your curly braces line up? Wish your code could automatically find that missing semicolon on its own? Well, good news: there’s a tool for that!

A linter is a tool that scans source code for potential issues, including syntax errors, faulty code structures, stylistic inconsistencies, and security. Linters can automatically detect missing semicolons or future security breaches early on during the development cycle to reduce the number of errors that need to be resolved during testing. Some popular linters include [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript, [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) for JavaScript, and [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS.

Why Should You Lint?

- Syntax Errors

Linters can automatically find and fix syntax errors before running your code, meaning fewer bugs to deal with during production.

- Problematic Code Structures (i.e. “Code Smells”)

Problematic Code Structures (i.e. “Code Smells”)
Linters can also flag potentially problematic code structures, or “code smells”. These are weak points in your application design, such as unnecessarily long methods and duplicated code, that could result in future bugs and impaired app performance.

- Security

Some linters, such as ESLint, can detect potential security vulnerabilities in your code to help you ensure that the application is secure and well-protected

What is the difference between Linters and Build Tools ?

Linting occurs as you write your code, whereas build tools are applied when only when you want to preview or ship your code base. However, linting can be a part of the build process with some build tools, such as Webpack or Parcel.
