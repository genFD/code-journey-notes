# BUILDING APPS WITH WEBPACK

## Introduction to Building Apps with Webpack

It’s time to practice using build tools!

We’ll use one of the most popular build tools, Webpack, to bundle:

- JavaScript files
- stylesheets
- images
- fonts
- text files

## Webpack Project Setup

- Set Up **package.json**

Webpack is a Node package. To use Node packages, we need a **package.json** which holds [important project metadata](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json) about any Node project. We can initialize a Node project using npm init in the terminal to make a package.json file. We can use the `-y` flag to use the default values for the metadata fields:

```bash
npm init -y
```

- Install Webpack and Webpack CLI

We need two packages, `webpack` and `webpack-cli`, to build our Webpack project with the command line.

`webpack` contains the main functionality, but `webpack-cli` allows command-line access to Webpack. We want these tools to be developer dependencies because they will not be used when the final product is running. We use `npm install` and the `--save-dev` flag to save packages as developer dependencies.

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```

**package.json** will list these packages under `devDependencies` for a local project.

- Make an entry point

A Webpack project requires an _entry point_ where it will find the main file to bundle. Webpack will throw a long error indicating a problem with `main` if there are no files at the entry point. The default Webpack entry point is **index.js** in a **src** folder, although this can be [changed](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/). If we want to use the default entry point, we should make an **src** folder with an **index.js** inside of it.

- Define the Build Command

A `build` command is often defined in the scripts section of **package.json** for running Webpack. You can find more information on the [scripts section here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts). Using a `build` command makes the way we build the project independent of what build tools we use. We define the build command like so:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "webpack --watch",
}
```

The webpack of the command just runs Webpack, `--watch` tells Webpack to automatically _look for updates_ to our file and _rebuild_ if any changes occur. This will be important when we preview our site.

We run the build command in the terminal with:

```bash
npm run build

```

When we’ve set up the **package.json**, entry point, and build command, Webpack is ready to go!.

## Packing _One_ JavaScript File

We will use Webpack to process a single JavaScript file in our project.

Big files take longer to load. However, as projects get bigger and more complex, they require a lot of code. We could try to write code using as few characters as possible, but this can make it very hard to read.

Can we write code that is easy to read but fast to download?

Yes! Build tools allow us to do just that. We can improve source code readability with functions, comments, and more. Webpack will remove much of this when creating the content served to the end-user. We can write easy-to-read code, run Webpack on it, and give the processed version to users. Both versions display the same content, and the user wouldn’t know the difference.

Let’s practice running Webpack on a JavaScript file and check out the optimized Webpack output

Take a look at the code in **index.js** :

```js
// index.js
const greetUser = () => {
  console.log('Hello User!')
}
const askUserStatus = () => {
  console.log('How are you?')
}
greetUser()
askUserStatus()
```

If we run the `build` command, the output produced by webapack will look like this(assuming you have already setup webpack):

```js
// dist/main.js
console.log('Hello User!'), console.log('How are you?')
```

Notice that there is _less code_ than in the source file.

## Packing _Multiple_ JavaScript File

Take a look at the file structure of our project :

```bash
files
├── src
│   ├── greetUser.js
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── myUser.js
├── test
└── package.json
```

```js
// myUser.js
const user = {
  username: 'Beepum',
  firstName: 'Gert',
}
export { user }
```

```js
// greetUser.js
const greet = (username, firstName) => {
  console.log(`Hello ${username}, or should I call you ${firstName}?`)
}

export { greet }
```

```js
// index.js
import { greet } from './greetUser.js'
import { user } from './myUser.js'
greet(user.username, user.firstName)
```

Our **src** directory has three JavaScript files. **greetUser.js** and **myUser.js** provide utility data and functionality to **index.js**.

In a typical static web project, we would have to put all three scripts into our HTML page and include them in the right order. Managing and importing these scripts gets harder as our projects get more complex. Build tools like Webpack help make including resources easier.

Webpack will allow us to use `import` and `export` statements on all our front-end files, not just JavaScript.

When we build Webpack stitches all our files together as if we wrote them as one.

Let’s run the `build` command, the output of the built code should look like:

```js
// dist/main.js

;(() => {
  'use strict'
  console.log('Hello Beepum, or should I call you Gert?')
})()
```

## Creating a Webpack Config

So far, we have been using Webpack without any configuration or settings. Let’s start customizing Webpack!

Webpack automatically looks for a configuration file named **webpack.config.js.** We define Webpack’s settings in an object, defined using the [module.exports syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export). We can define an empty one like so:

```js
// webpack.config.js.
module.exports = {}
```

Now that we have a config file, we can set the mode :

```js
// webpack.config.js.
module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
}
```

- 'development' mode is used when we develop our app, producing a more readable version of the output.

- We switch to 'production' when we have a finished version, which makes the output less readable and more compact. You can read more about [Webpack’s modes here](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).

If we run the build command, the ouput of the build code should look like :

```js
/*
 * ATTENTION: The "eval" devtool has been used (maybe by default in mode: "development").
 * This devtool is neither made for production nor for readable output files.
 * It uses "eval()" calls to create a separate source file in the browser devtools.
 * If you are trying to read the output file, select a different devtool (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
 * or disable the default devtool with "devtool: false".
 * If you are looking for production-ready output files, see mode: "production" (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).
 */
/******/ ;(() => {
  // webpackBootstrap
  /******/ var __webpack_modules__ = {
    /***/ './src/index.js':
      /*!**********************!*\
  !*** ./src/index.js ***!
  \**********************/
      /***/ () => {
        eval(
          "const greetUser = () => {\n  console.log('Hello User!');\n}\nconst askUserStatus = () => {\n  console.log('How are you?');\n}\ngreetUser();\naskUserStatus();\n\n//# sourceURL=webpack://blank-workspace/./src/index.js?"
        )

        /***/
      },

    /******/
  }
  /************************************************************************/
  /******/
  /******/ // startup
  /******/ // Load entry module and return exports
  /******/ // This entry module can't be inlined because the eval devtool is used.
  /******/ var __webpack_exports__ = {}
  /******/ __webpack_modules__['./src/index.js']()
  /******/
  /******/
})()
```

Note that because the `mode` has been set to '`development`', the output contains comments explaining what’s happening. These will be removed when the `mode` is set to '`production`'.

## Defining Entry and Exit Points

We will use the configuration file to change where Webpack looks for files to bundle and where it places its output.

So far, we have used Webpack’s default entry point of **./src/index.js.** However, it is common for projects to have the main file stored under a different folder or a different name.

Let’s say that we wanted to write our main application code in **application/home.js**. We can tell Webpack that this is the main file and that it should start bundling here by defining an _entry point_ in the config file’s JSON object at the same level as `mode` or `module` :

```js
// webpack.config.js.
module.exports = {
  entry: './application/home.js',
}
```

The entry point allows us to define a path relative to where our **webpack.config.js** is located.

We may also want to set the name of the output file or its directory. Let’s say we want our processed JavaScript file to be in the **built** directory, and to be called **fast.js**. We can accomplish this by defining an _exit point_.

Unlike the _entry point_, the _exit point_ requires an absolute path, which is best specified with the [path Node module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/path.html). We set the exit point under the output configuration option like so:

```js
// webpack.config.js.
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  entry: './application/home.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'fast.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'built'),
  },
  // ...
}
```

The name of the bundled JavaScript file is specified with filename, and its directory with path. The `path.resolve()` method _combines_ the path to the current directory with the folder name we want to place the bundled code in.

Given the configuration above, running Webpack would produce a **built/fast.js**.

## Viewing Our App with Webpack Dev Server

We will use a tool called [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to preview our code and update it as we make changes.

We would first install `webpack-dev-server` as a development dependency in a local environment:

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server

```

Next, we need an HTML document, and it should embed the JavaScript from our exit point:

```html
<script src="./dist/main.js"></script>
```

To use `webpack-dev-server`, we’ll add start command to **package.json** inside of the scripts section.

```json
"build": "webpack --watch",
"start": "webpack serve"
```

The serve command is going to serve our build and refresh when the build changes.

In order to have our project update any time we make changes, we would typically run each of these commands in a separate terminal.

We would first run the build command in one terminal, to create the bundle and wait for updates.

```bash
npm run build
```

We would next launch a second terminal and run the `start` command to serve the site.

```bash
npm run start

```

## Introduction to Webpack `Rules`

Webpack uses rules to know what to do with different file types. Webpack expects an array of rules in a configuration option called `module`. The syntax looks like:

```js
// webpack.config.js.

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [],
  },
}
```

A rule has a `test` configuration option defined as a _regular expression_. If a file matches the regular expression, Webpack will use the rule on that file. For example, if we define `test` as `\.txt$\i`, the rule will apply to files ending in **.txt**.

The other part of the rule needs to tell Webpack what to do with files that match the test. That part of the rule varies by file type.

For **.txt** files, the rule inside of rules would look like:

```js
// webpack.config.js.

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.txt$/i,
        type: 'asset/source',
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Here, `type: 'asset/source'` is telling Webpack that **.txt** files are an asset that can be added directly to the source code, not requiring much processing. Once we add a rule for a file type, we can import files of that type into our code. Here’s an example with a **.txt** file:

```js
import Text from './example.txt'
document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = Text
```

Previewing this code replaces the content of the page `h1` element with the file content.

## Adding CSS to Our Builds

Let’s add CSS stylesheets into our Webpack project.

The `test` configuration option for CSS follows the same structure as the **.txt** file rule:

```js
test: /\.css$/i
```

While we import **.txt** files as assets, other file types often need _loaders_ to get bundled by Webpack. Instead of a `type` attribute, files that use one or several loaders require a `use` attribute.

CSS files use two loaders, `css-loader` and `style-loader.`

- `css-loader` takes the CSS out of a **.css** file and adds it to the JavaScript code.
- `style-loader` takes the output of `css-loader` and puts it in a style tag in the HTML.

We need both loaders. We specify multiple loaders with an array, and Webpack applies them in reverse order.

The rule for CSS files looks like:

```js
// webpack.config.js.

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

In a local environment, we’d also install the loaders as developer dependencies.

```sh
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader

```

We can then import CSS files directly into our JavaScript using another form of the `import` statement:

```js
import './style.css'
import Text from './example.txt'
document.querySelector('h1').innerHTML = Text
```

When we build and start our preview server, the CSS is applied to the HTML!

## Adding Images to Our Builds

Since Webpack 5, images and fonts no longer need a loader, and can use Webpack’s asset system. Their rules are similar to that of **.txt** files.

```js
// webpack.config.js.

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.png$/i,
        type: 'asset/resource',
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Notice we use `type` with `asset/resource` rather than `asset/source`. `asset/resource` creates a file in the build and imports it into the code as a URL. The rule above would only match with **\*.png** files, but we could have it handle many image types:

```js
{
  test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
  type: 'asset/resource'
}
```

When an image rule has been defined in webpack.config.js, we can import images into our JavaScript as if they were code:

```js
import Square from '../square.png'
const img = document.createElement('img')
img.src = Square
const body = document.querySelector('body')
body.appendChild(img)
```

When we build, the image is in the site!

## Adding Fonts to Our Builds

Their rules are similar to the image rule.

```js
// webpack.config.js.

module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.ttf$/i,
        type: 'asset/resource',
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

The rule above would only match with **\.ttf** format, but we might want to be able to use multiple font file types:

```js
{
  test: /\.(woff|woff2|eot|ttf|otf)$/i,
  type: 'asset/resource'
}
```

Unlike the other resources we’ve seen so far, font files are imported in CSS, not in JavaScript. We use a font in our CSS like so:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto-Black';
  src: url('../Roboto-Black.ttf');
}

h1 {
  font-family: 'Roboto-Black';
}
```

The `url` is the location of the font file. We use `font-family` to define a name for our font that we can use later in the CSS.

When we build the project, we can see our fonts!
