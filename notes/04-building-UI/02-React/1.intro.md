# A First look at REACT

## Why do we need REACT?

Front-end applications are all about :

- handling data + displaying data in a UI (browser...)

The UI needs to be in sync with data. But this is really hard problem to solve.
Building an app solely with JS and JQuery :

1. Requires a lot of direct DOM manipulation and traversing (imperative code) : manual elements selection, DOM traversing, class toggling

2. State is stored in the DOM rather than a central place in the application which can introduce bugs.

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [advice, setAdvice] = useState('')
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  async function getAdvice() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice')
    const data = await res.json()
    setAdvice(data.slip.advice)
    setCount((c) => c + 1)
  }

  useEffect(function () {
    getAdvice()
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{advice}</h1>
      <button onClick={getAdvice}>Get advice</button>
      <Message count={count} />
    </div>
  )
}

function Message(props) {
  return (
    <p>
      You have read <strong>{props.count}</strong> pieces of advice
    </p>
  )
}
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Vanilla JS Advice</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="advice"></h1>
    <button class="btn">Get advice</button>
    <p>You have read <strong class="count"></strong> pieces of advice</p>

    <script>
      // Manually selecting DOM elements (which require a class or ID in markup)
      const adviceEl = document.querySelector('.advice')
      const btnEl = document.querySelector('.btn')
      const countEl = document.querySelector('.count')

      const getAdvice = async function () {
        const res = await fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice')
        const data = await res.json()

        // Updating values
        advice = data.slip.advice
        count = count + 1

        // Manually updating DOM elements
        countEl.textContent = count
        adviceEl.textContent = advice
      }

      // Setting initial values
      let count = 0
      let advice
      getAdvice()

      // Attaching an event listener
      btnEl.addEventListener('click', getAdvice)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

- In react we don't need to manually select DOM elements
- Unlike vanilla JS where changing the state does not affect the UI(we need to manually update the DOM) with React, as soon as the piece of state changes the UI will automatically be updated.

## Why REACT?

Here are just a few of the reasons why people choose to program with React:

- React is _fast_. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.

- React is _modular_. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. React’s modularity can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript’s maintainability problems.

- React is _scalable_. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.

- React is _flexible_. You can use React for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app. People are still figuring out React’s potential. There’s room to explore.

- React is _popular_. While this reason has admittedly little to do with React’s quality, the truth is that understanding React will make you more employable.
