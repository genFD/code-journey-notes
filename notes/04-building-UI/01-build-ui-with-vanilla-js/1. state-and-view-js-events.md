# State and View, JS and Events

`TLDR`:

- The DOM is a representation of the elements rendered on the page
- Javascript allows us to create and save data/state
- The Document object allow us (developers) to interact in JS with the DOM
- Event handlers allow us to let the user change data in JS.

## UI development overview

### Almost every piece of technology needs a visual UI

- What is UI ?

Content displayed on a screen that a user can _interact_ with.
For example :

- Tik Tok : allow you to view video, create video, like and comment, etc..

Everything we see on the screen is related to data under the hood :

- Videos
- Number of views
- Number of likes
- Photos
- Comments etc..

There are two goals to `UI engineering` :

1. display content (state/data) on the screen
2. allow users to interact with that content i.e change underlying data

We will focus on the web browser, but there are many others "machine" that display content and allow users to interact with that content :

- Pilot dashboard
- Microwave etc..

### First problem: How do we display content in the web browser?

#### HTML : How does HTML is rendered under the hood?

It's a 3 steps process :

`index.html`

1. first, we add in an html document, a list of elements that we want to display on the page like so :

```html
<h1>What's on your mind?</h1>
<input />
<button>Publish</button>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
<p>♥️7</p>
```

⤵️

2. That list of elements in HTML above produces a list of elements in c++ called the DOM - Model (representation) of the page. We can imagine that this list would look something like the following:

```c++
[

 - input
 - button
   -- 'publish'
 -p
   --'Happy new year!'
 -p
   --'♥️ 7'
]
```

3. That List of elements in c++ is then converted by the _layout and render engine_ into actual pixels rendered on a page

### How do we display dynamic data on the screen?

_TLDR_:

- by using `Javascript`

1. The script element triggers the js engine : `<script src="app.js"></script>`

2. The global memory in `js` is populated with the `document object.` This object is full of methods and properties that allow us to interact with DOM.

3. Data is created and stored in `js` : `let post = 'hi!'`

4. The output of calling methods like querySelector, is an accessor object full of properties and methods that allow us to interact with the _selected dom element_: `const jsdiv = document.querySelector('div')`

5. We can use the textContent(built-in property) to add data from `js` to DOM element like so : `jsdiv.textContent = post`

6. DOM automatically display content on the page

What a user sees on the screen is under the hood stored as data. So to enable users to change the content they see, we need to enable them to change the underlying data.

We can do this is by using `javascript`.
`javascript` is essential for two reasons :

1. Create and save data/state
2. Run code to change data.

Here’s an example of how we can display data on the screen:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<input />
<div></div>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

⤵️

This list of elements in HTML above produces a list of elements in c++ called the DOM - Model (representation) of the page. We can imagine that this list would look something like the following:

```c++
DOM - Model (representation) of the page
[
NODES :
 - input
 - div
 - script --> <App.js>
]
```

```js
// app.js
let post = 'hi!'

const jsdiv = document.querySelector('div')

jsdiv.textContent = post
```

This is how it works :

- Our HTML code is parsed

- Three nodes are added to the DOM

- Adding the `script node` triggers the `js` engine

- In our `js` file :

  - We defined a variable `post` and assign to it the string '`hi`'

  - We also defined a constant `jsdiv` and assign to it the result of calling the `querySelector` method which is on the document object, passing in the string '`div`'. The `querySelector` method is going to query(search) the first `div` element in the DOM. However, we cannot bring back in `js` something that was written in C++ (remember that the browser language is C++). That's why under the hood, `querySelector` is going to create an _object_ in `js` that's going to have an hidden link to the `div` node in C++. This object is also going to be populated with a lot of functions and properties (like textConent) to interact with that `div`.

  - On the next line, we access the `jsdiv` object and we set the `textContent` property of the `div` (DOM node) to be the value of `post`, which evaluates to the string `hi`.

This is how we use `js` to create and save data/state and the DOM to display data on the screen.

### How do we enable users to add data on the page and use that data to re-update the DOM ?

`TLDR` : Thanks to DOM event API.

Here’s an example of how that might work:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<input />
<div></div>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

// app.js
let post = ''
const jsInput = document.querySelector('input')

const jsdiv = document.querySelector('div')

function handleInput() {
  post = jsInput.value // affect js
  jsDiv.textContent = post
}

jsInput.onInput = handleInput
```

This is how it works :

- Same steps as before, HTML gets loaded into the parser

- Three nodes are added to the DOM(list)

- Adding the `script node` triggers the `js` engine

- In our `js` file :

  - We defined a variable `post` and assign to it an empty string

  - We defined a constant `jsInput` and assigned to it the _return value_ of calling the `querySelector` method passing in string 'input'. The ouput is an accesor _object_ with an hidden link to the `<input/>` element on the DOM. This object is also full of methods and properties (such as `value`, `onInput`) that allow us to interact with this DOM node .

  - On the next line, we defined the constant `jsDiv` and assigned to it the return value of calling the querySelector method passing in the string `div`. The ouput is an accesor _object_ with an hidden link to to the first div element on the DOM. This object is also full of methods and properties (such as `textContent`) that allow us to interact with this DOM node.

  - Next, we defined a function called `handleInput`

  - Finally, we access the object `jsInput` and we set the property `onInput` to be the function `handleInput`. (The technical term for handleInput is an _event handler_). This means that whenever a user enters or deletes any character inside the `<input>` `handleInput` will be call back and executed.

For example, if a user type '`hi`' in the input element :

- The value property of the input element will be set to '`hi`'.

```js
post = jsInput.value
```

- The function `handleInput` will be automatically triggered. `handleInput` goes into the callback queue and then is pushed onto the call stack. A brand new execution context is created :

  - `post` is reassigned the value entered by the user
  - the `jsDiv` object `textContent`'s property is reassigned to `post` which evaluates to '`hi`'

- The DOM is updated with the new value from `js` and the page re-renders.

**Note**:

Notice that every change of data (like user input) is going to require a back and forth between C++ (DOM) and JavaScript (app.js). There's no permanent bond in JS memory and in C++ memory.

Every single change is going to require a manual running of a handler function `handleInput` which is going to change data in `js` :

```js
let post = '' // -> 'hi'
function handleInput() {
  post = jsInput.value // change data js
  ...
}
```

and a manual execution of a setter (like `textContent`) to change data in C++ and update the DOM :

```js
const jsdiv = document.querySelector('div')
let post = '' // -> 'hi'
function handleInput() {
  ...
  jsDiv.textContent = post  // update the DOM
}
```

In the next lesson we're going to discuss the challenges of about data binding in the UI.
