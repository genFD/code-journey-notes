## Learning Objectives

State is what makes your applications move. What many of us are not often aware of is that there are different types of state. These different types lead to different challenges when managing the given state. In this part, we will understand more about state and how we manage it. During this process, we will understand that the server and client states have very different challenges that need to be handled separately and with different tools. To deal with server state, we will learn more about the TanStack Query React adapter called React Query and see how to add it to our applications.

This part includes the following chapters:

## Notes

### Chapter 1, What Is State and How Do We Manage It?

### Chapter 2, Server State versus Client State

### Chapter 3, React Query – Introducing, Installing, and Configuring It
