# JSX

## Learning Goals

## TLDR

- React is a modular, scalable, flexible, and popular front-end framework.

- `JSX` is a syntax extension for JavaScript which allows us to treat HTML as expressions.They can be stored in variables, objects, arrays, and more!

- `JSX` elements can have attributes and be nested within each other, just like in HTML.

- `JSX` must have exactly one outer element, and other elements can be nested inside.

- `createRoot()` from `react-dom/client` can be used to create a React root at the specified DOM element.

- A React root’s `render()` method can be used to render JSX on the screen.

- A React root’s `render()` method only updates DOM elements that have changed using the virtual DOM.

## Hello World

Take a look at the following line of code:

```js
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>
```

What kind of weird hybrid code is that? Is it JavaScript? HTML? Or something else?

It seems like it must be JavaScript since it starts with const and ends with ;. If you tried to run that in an HTML file, it wouldn’t work.

However, the code also contains `<h1>Hello world</h1>`, which looks exactly like HTML. That part wouldn’t work if you tried to run it in a JavaScript file.

What’s going on?

The part that looks like HTML, `<h1>Hello world</h1>`, is something called `JSX`.

## What is JSX?

`JSX` is a `syntax extension for JavaScript`. It was written to be used with React. JSX code looks a lot like HTML

What does “syntax extension” mean?

- it means that JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can’t read it

- If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be _compiled_. This means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX _compiler_ will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

## JSX Elements

A basic unit of `JSX` is called a JSX _element_.

Here’s an example of a JSX element:

```jsx
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```

This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that `you would find it in a JavaScript file`, instead of in an HTML file.

## JSX Elements And Their Surroundings

JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array… you name it.

Here’s an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:

```jsx
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>
```

Here’s an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:

```jsx
const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>,
}
```

## Attributes In JSX

JSX elements can have attributes, just like how HTML elements can.

Here are some JSX elements with attributes:

```jsx
;<a href="http://www.example.com">Welcome to the Web</a>

const title = <h1 id="title">Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>
```

A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:

```jsx
const panda = <img src='images/panda.jpg' alt='panda' width='500px' height='500px'>;

```

## Nested JSX

You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.

Here’s an example of a JSX `<h1>` element, nested inside of a JSX `<a>` element

```jsx
<a href="https://www.example.com">
  <h1>Click me!</h1>
</a>
```

If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses. This looks strange at first, but you get used to it:

```jsx
render(
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>Click me!</h1>
  </a>
)
```

Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions, etc., just like non-nested JSX expressions can! Here’s an example of a nested JSX expression being saved as a variable:

```jsx
const theExample = (
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>Click me!</h1>
  </a>
)
```

## JSX Outer Elements

A JSX expression must have exactly _one_ outermost element.
In other words, this code will work:

```jsx
const paragraphs = (
  <div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
)
```

But this code will not work:

```jsx
const paragraphs = (
  <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
  <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
);
```

The first _opening tag_ and the final _closing tag_ of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element!

```jsx
// Don't
const blog = (
  <img src="pics/192940u73.jpg" />
  <h1>
    Welcome to Dan's Blog!
  </h1>
  <article>
    Wow I had the tastiest sandwich today. I <strong>literally</strong> almost freaked out.
  </article>
);
// DO
const blog = (
 <div>
   <img src="pics/192940u73.jpg" />
  <h1>
    Welcome to Dan's Blog!
  </h1>
  <article>
    Wow I had the tastiest sandwich today. I <strong>literally</strong> almost freaked out.
  </article>
 <div/>
);
```

## Rendering JSX

To _render_ a JSX expression means to make it appear on screen.

The following code will render a JSX expression:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

const app = document.getElementById('app')

const root = createRoot(container)

root.render(<h1>Hello world</h1>)
```

React relies on two things to render:

1. what content to render
2. and where to place the content at.

```jsx
const app = document.getElementById('app')
```

This line:

- Uses the document object which represents our web page.
- Uses the`getElementById()` method of document to get the `Element object` representing the HTML element with the passed in id (app).
- Stores the element in container.

In the next line:

```jsx
const root = createRoot(container)
```

- we use createRoot() from the react-dom/client library, which creates a React root from container and stores it in root.

`root` can be used to render a JSX expression. This is the “`where to place the content”` part of React rendering.

Finally, the last line:

```jsx
root.render(<h1>Hello world</h1>)
```

uses the render() method of root to render the content passed in as an argument. Here we pass an `<h1>`element, which displays `Hello world`. This is the `“what content to render”` part of React rendering.

### Passing a Variable to render()

In the previous exercise, we saw how we can create a React root using `createRoot()` and use its `render()` method to render JSX.

The render() method’s argument doesn’t need to be JSX, but it should evaluate to a JSX expression. The argument could also be a variable, so long as that variable evaluates to a JSX expression.

In this example, we save a JSX expression as a variable named toDoList. We then pass toDoList as the argument of render():

```jsx
const toDoList = (
  <ol>
    <li>Learn React</li>
    <li>Become a Developer</li>
  </ol>
)
// Where to render
const container = document.getElementById('app')
const root = createRoot(container)

// What to render
root.render(toDoList)
```

### The Virtual DOM

One important thing about a React root’s `render()` method is that it _only updates DOM elements that have changed_.

As a result, if you render the exact same thing twice in a row, the second render will do nothing:

```jsx
const hello = <h1>Hello world</h1>

// This will add "Hello world" to the screen:
root.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'))

// This won't do anything at all:
root.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'))
```

This is significant! Only updating the necessary DOM elements is a large part of what makes React so successful. This is accomplished using React’s `virtual DOM.`

#### How React’s virtual DOM prevents wasteful DOM manipulation

##### The Problem

DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern, interactive web. Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most JavaScript operations.

This slowness is made worse by the fact that **most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to**.

As an example, let’s say that you have a list that contains ten items. You check off the first item. Most JavaScript frameworks would rebuild the _entire list_. That’s ten times more work than necessary! Only one item changed, but the remaining nine get rebuilt exactly how they were before.

Rebuilding a list is no big deal to a web browser, but modern websites can use huge amounts of DOM manipulation. Inefficient updating has become a serious problem.

To address this problem, the people at React popularized something called the virtual DOM.

##### The Solution

In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a _representation_ of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.

A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing’s power to directly change what’s on the screen.

Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster because nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

When you render a JSX element:

1. Every single virtual DOM object gets updated. This sounds incredibly inefficient, but the cost is insignificant because the virtual DOM can update so quickly(it's stored in memory in JS).

2. Once the virtual DOM has been updated, then React compares the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM snapshot that was taken right before the update. By comparing the new virtual DOM with a pre-update version, React figures out _exactly which virtual DOM objects have changed_. This process is called “diffing.”

3. Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, then React updates those objects, and _only those objects_, on the real DOM. In our example from earlier, React would be smart enough to rebuild your one checked-off list-item and leave the rest of your list alone.

This makes a big difference! React can update only the necessary parts of the DOM. React’s reputation for performance comes largely from this innovation.

In summary, here’s what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

1. The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
2. The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
3. The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
4. Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.

## class vs className

Grammar in JSX is mostly the same as in HTML, but there are subtle differences to watch out for. The most frequent of these involves the word `class`.

In HTML, it’s common to use `class` as an attribute name:

```html
<h1 class="big">Title</h1>
```

In JSX, you can’t use the word class! You have to use className instead

```html
<h1 className="big">Title</h1>
```

This is because JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and `class` is a reserved word in JavaScript.

When JSX is _rendered_, JSX className attributes are automatically rendered as class attributes.

## Self-Closing Tags

Another common JSX error involves self-closing tags

Most HTML elements use two tags: an opening tag `(<div>)`, and a closing tag `(</div>)`. However, some HTML elements such as `<img>` and `<input>` use only one tag.

The tag that belongs to a single-tag element isn’t an opening tag or a closing tag; it’s a self-closing tag.

When you write a self-closing tag in HTML, it is _optional_ to include a forward slash immediately before the final angle bracket:

```html
// Fine in HTML with a slash:
<br />

// Also fine, without the slash:
<br />
```

But, in JSX, you have to include the slash. If you write a self-closing tag in JSX and forget the slash, you will raise an error:

```jsx
// Fine in JSX:
<br />

// NOT FINE AT ALL in JSX:
<br>
```

## JavaScript In Your JSX In Your JavaScript

So far, we’ve focused on writing JSX expressions. It’s similar to writing bits of HTML, but inside of a JavaScript file.

We’re going to add something new: regular JavaScript, written inside of a JSX expression, written inside of a JavaScript file.

### Curly Braces in JSX

Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript! JSX doesn’t add numbers—it reads them as text, just like HTML.

You need a way to write code that says, _“Even though I am located in between JSX tags, treat me like ordinary JavaScript and not like JSX.”_

You can do this by wrapping your code in _curly braces_.

```jsx
const pi = (
  <div>
    <h1>PI, YALL!</h1>
    <p>{Math.PI.toFixed(20)}</p>
  </div>
)
ReactDOM.render(pi, document.getElementById('app'))
```

### Variables in JSX

When you inject JavaScript into JSX, that JavaScript is part of the same environment as the rest of the JavaScript in your file.

That means that you can access variables while inside of a JSX expression, even if those variables were declared outside of the JSX code block.

```jsx
// Declare a variable:
const name = 'Gerdo'

// Access your variable inside of a JSX expression:
const greeting = <p>Hello, {name}!</p>
```

When writing JSX, it’s common to use variables to set attributes.

Here’s an example of how that might work:

```jsx
// Use a variable to set the `height` and `width` attributes:

const sideLength = '200px'

const panda = (
  <img
    src="images/panda.jpg"
    alt="panda"
    height={sideLength}
    width={sideLength}
  />
)
```

Object properties are also often used to set attributes:

```jsx
const pics = {
  panda: 'http://bit.ly/1Tqltv5',
  owl: 'http://bit.ly/1XGtkM3',
  owlCat: 'http://bit.ly/1Upbczi',
}

const panda = <img src={pics.panda} alt="Lazy Panda" />

const owl = <img src={pics.owl} alt="Unimpressed Owl" />

const owlCat = <img src={pics.owlCat} alt="Ghastly Abomination" />
```

### Event Listeners in JSX

JSX elements can have _event listeners_, just like HTML elements can. Programming in React means constantly working with event listeners.

You create an event listener by giving a JSX element a special attribute. Here’s an example:

```jsx
<img onClick={clickAlert} />
```

An _event listener_ attribute’s _name_ should be something like `onClick` or `onMouseOver`: the word on plus the type of event that you’re listening for. Look through the [common components list in React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#) to browse supported event names.

An event listener attribute’s value should be a function, like in the above example.

**Note**: In HTML, event listener names are written in all lowercase, such as `onclick` or `onmouseover`. In JSX, event listener names are written in _camelCase_, such as `onClick` or `onMouseOver`.

### JSX Conditionals: If Statements That Don't Work

Here’s a rule that you need to know: you can not inject an if statement into a JSX expression.

This code will break:

```jsx
render
(
  <h1>
    {
      if (purchase.complete) {
        'Thank you for placing an order!' // this will break
      }
    }
  </h1>
)
```

What if you want a JSX expression to render but only under certain circumstances? You can’t inject an `if` statement. What can you do?

You have lots of options.

1. One option is to write an if statement and not inject it into JSX.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

const container = document.getElementById('app')
const root = createRoot(container)
let message

if (user.age >= drinkingAge) {
  message = <h1>Hey, check out this alcoholic beverage!</h1>
} else {
  message = <h1>Hey, check out these earrings I got at Claire's!</h1>
}

root.render(message)
```

It works because the words `if` and `else` are not injected in between JSX tags.
The `if`statement is on the outside, and no JavaScript injection is necessary. This is a common way to express conditionals in JSX.

2. There’s a more compact way to write conditionals in JSX: the _ternary operator_.

Here’s how you might use the ternary operator in a JSX expression:

```jsx
const headline = <h1>{age >= drinkingAge ? 'Buy Drink' : 'Do Teen Stuff'}</h1>
```

In the above example, if `age` is greater than or equal to `drinkingAge`, then headline will equal`<h1>Buy Drink</h1>`. Otherwise, headline will equal `<h1>Do Teen Stuff</h1>`

3. Like the ternary operator, `&&` is not React-specific, but it shows up in React very often

`&&` works best for conditionals that will sometimes do an action but other times do nothing at all.

Here’s an example:

```jsx
const tasty = (
  <ul>
    <li>Applesauce</li>
    {!baby && <li>Pizza</li>}
    {age > 15 && <li>Brussels Sprouts</li>}
    {age > 20 && <li>Oysters</li>}
    {age > 25 && <li>Grappa</li>}
  </ul>
)
```

if the expression on the left of the `&&` evaluates as true, then the JSX on the right of the `&&` will be rendered. If the first expression is false, however, then the JSX to the right of the `&&` will be ignored and not rendered.

### .map in JSX

If you want to create a list of JSX elements, then using `.map()` is often the most efficient way. It can look odd at first:

```jsx
const strings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me']

const listItems = strings.map((string) => <li>{string}</li>)

;<ul>{listItems}</ul>
```

In the above example, we start out with an array of strings. We call `.map()` on this array of strings, and the `.map()`call returns a new array of `<li>s`.

On the last line of the example, note that `{listItems}` will evaluate to an array, because it’s the returned value of `.map()`! JSX `<li>s` don’t have to be in an array like this, but they can be.

```jsx
// This is fine in JSX, not in an explicit array:
;<ul>
  <li>item 1</li>
  <li>item 2</li>
  <li>item 3</li>
</ul>

// This is also fine!
const liArray = [<li>item 1</li>, <li>item 2</li>, <li>item 3</li>]

;<ul>{liArray}</ul>
```

#### Keys

When you make a list in JSX, sometimes your list will need to include something called `keys` :

```jsx
<ul>
  <li key="li-01">Example1</li>
  <li key="li-02">Example2</li>
  <li key="li-03">Example3</li>
</ul>
```

A `key` is a JSX attribute. The attribute’s _name_ is `key`. The attribute’s _value_ should be something unique, similar to an `id` attribute.

`keys` don’t do anything visible! React uses them internally to keep track of lists. If you don’t use keys when you’re supposed to, React might accidentally scramble your list items into the wrong order.

Not all lists need to have `keys`. A list needs `keys` if either of the following is true:

1. The list items have _memory_ from one render to the next. For instance, when a to-do list renders, each item must _“remember”_ whether it was checked off. The items shouldn’t get amnesia when they render.

2. A list’s order might be _shuffled_. For instance, a list of search results might be shuffled from one render to the next.

If neither of these conditions is true, then you don’t have to worry about `keys`. If you aren’t sure, then it never hurts to use them!

### React.createElement

You can write React code without using JSX at all!

The majority of React programmers do use JSX, but you should understand that it is possible to write React code without it.

The following JSX expression

```jsx
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>
```

can be rewritten without JSX, like this:

```jsx
const h1 = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello world')
```

When a JSX element is compiled, the compiler transforms the JSX element into the method that you see above: `React.createElement()`. _Every JSX element is secretly a call to React.createElement()_

check out the [React documentation on createElement() to learn more](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement).
