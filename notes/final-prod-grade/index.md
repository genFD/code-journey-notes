<!-- We will be building `an application that allows organizations to manage their customers complaints (negative feedbacks)`.

The organization admins or customer representative can :
Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests

- record new complaints
- Filter complaints by status (pending/inresolved)
- Sort complaints by priority based on customer's value
- Change complaints priority level
- mark pending complaints as resolved or in/progress
- Add comments and replies to a complaint

APP requirements :

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle light and dark mode
